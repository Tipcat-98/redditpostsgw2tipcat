Hi, you may know me as Tipcat, aka the crazy cat person who mains Mesmer in PvE. <br>
Visions of Eternity, and by extension, Troubadour has been out for a little while now, and I have been playing it extensively in all types of content.

So, I figured I should make a feedback post of my own and the sc help desk community's feedback and wanted changes.

Let's start by reviewing the changes from the beta to the release of the expansion.

## Beta to release review

In the beta, we saw power Troubadour doing around 48.6k damage with relatively little time to refine rotations, as both me and Cemox didn't really have too much time during the beta. <br>
As a note, I personally think that iteration of power Troubadour could hit 51k.

In the current release, we see **power Troubadour** doing around 43k damage, with an alternative harder-to-play Power Block setup resulting in a 17% damage increase potential (around 50k with max uptime). <br>
Overall, power Troubadour plays a lot like power Virtuoso, but it has some nice traits and other distinctions to set it apart. <br>
A big one being Syncopate, which capitalises on the fact that Troubadour already has more frequent disables than any other Mesmer build. <br>
This opens up options and synergises with a lot of things within the Mesmer kit. <br>
For one, we can take Shield as a viable off-hand weapon, which is a first, but we can also take Power Block over Vicious Expressions in Domination which yields a nice damage increase, resulting in a more active gameplay loop where you have to make sure you interrupt your target for damage. <br>
It also opens up use for potential use of Mantra of Distraction as a DPS tool. 

**Condition Troubadour** didn't see much play as a lot of interactions weren't working properly, and surprise, they still aren't working all too well. <br>
These include Call and Response not triggering Shatter effects like Maim the Disillusioned, Cry of Pain, or even Mayhem. <br>
More detail will be spent talking about Call and Response later in this post. <br>
We did see dedicated players managing to push condition and condition quickness Troubadour to 37k and 33k, respectively. <br>
Which makes it look not completely devoid of hope as a build. 

**Heal Troubadour**, while providing more raw heal output and barrier, is still found to be lacking a lot of utility compared to its older sibling in Heal Chronomancer. <br>
This has been remedied a little bit by giving Tale of the Honorable Rogue Aegis instead of Stability. <br>
However, other Tales saw a reduction if performance with the removal of some of its effects. <br>
Distortion share is not as big of a balance shakeup anymore in today's Guild Wars 2 as other forms of utility and tools have been power crept in its absence, which means it doesn't really have too much of an unique advantage over Heal Chronomancer. <br>
Taking Tale of the August Queen also means sacrificing a lot of CC output due to dropping Signet of Humility. <br>
But we will also go into Heal Chronomancer a tiny bit, and what could be done in this post. <br>

In the release, we saw a fair amount of nerfs to our damage output but also changes that made the rotation easier to execute. <br>
Unfortunately I think the nerfs were a bit overzealous, and the gameplay changes a bit lacking since we still struggle a fair bit.

But okay, what actually changed?

    Reverberating Lute: This skill has been reworked and renamed Lively Lute. Send damaging sound waves toward an enemy and healing tones toward allies.
    Deafening Drum: Increased the speed of the shock wave.
    Harmonious Harp: This skill has been reworked. Gain distortion as you channel the harp, continuously healing nearby allies.
    Crescendo: Reduced the power coefficient from 1.25 to 1.0 in WvW and PvP.
    Tale of the Second Scion: Reduced the cooldown from 25 seconds to 15 seconds and reduced the casting time by 0.25 seconds. Reduced the base self-healing from 4,815 to 3,535 and the base ally healing from 3,530 to 2,250. This skill now always applies Scion's Reprieve to allies and grants a note when used while two or more instruments are playing. Reduced the Scion's Reprieve healing increase from 33% to 20% in PvE and from 20% to 15% in WvW and PvP.
    Tale of the Soulkeeper: This skill now applies quickness in addition to its previous effects. This skill no longer applies alacrity in PvE.
    Tale of the Tortured Mastermind: Reduced the cooldown from 25 seconds to 20 seconds in PvE only. Increased the power coefficient per hit from 0.75 to 1.0 and increased the daze duration from 2 seconds to 3 seconds in PvE only. This skill now always applies torment on hit and grants a note when used while the flute is playing.
    Tale of the Honorable Rogue: This skill no longer applies swiftness and removes movement-impairing conditions and instead applies aegis in PvE and PvP and stability in WvW. This skill now always applies superspeed and grants a note when used while the drums are playing.
    Tale of the Valiant Marshal: This skill now applies stability instead of protection in PvE and PvP. This skill now grants a note instead of barrier when used while the harp is playing.
    Wandering Minstrel: This trait now grants a note every 10 seconds while out of combat.
    Mayhem: This trait now reduces the cooldown of Flustering Flute when you dodge and no longer heals when applying torment or confusion while the flute is playing.
    Raconteur: This trait has been reworked and moved to the adept tier, replacing Hold the Note. This trait now causes tales to heal and grant protection to nearby allies.
    Syncopate: This trait no longer requires the drum to be playing to deal damage when you disable.
    Symphonic Resonance: This trait has been reworked and moved to the master tier minor trait slot. Gain unique bonuses for each instrument playing.
        Lute: Increased outgoing damage and healing.
        Flute: Increased endurance regeneration.
        Drum: Increased movement speed.
        Harp: Heal nearby allies every second.
    Shredding: This trait now causes Lively Lute to fire an additional projectile instead of increasing damage per wave. Reduced the damage increase while the lute is playing from 20% to 15% in PvE only.
    Life of the Party: This is a new trait in the master tier. Lively Lute and Crescendo apply boons to affected allies.
    Love Song: This trait has been reworked. It causes Harmonious Harp's distortion to last longer and reduces incoming strike damage from nearby enemies while the harp is playing.
    Harmonize: This trait has been reworked and moved to the grandmaster tier minor trait slot. Gain a note when you use a phantasm skill.
    Fortissimo: Reduced the attribute increase per instrument playing from 5% to 4%.
    Altered Chord: This trait now requires an instrument to consume at least one note to grant the Crescendo recharge.

Overall, the changes made the rotations easier to execute because we are less note-starved with the new Harmonize trait iteration, as well as the Tales no longer relying as much on the corresponding instrument for maximum effect. <br>
But as mentioned, we lost some damage through Fortissimo going from 5 to 4% all stats per instrument, and by losing the Harmonize modifier per instrument. <br>
The new Symphonic Resonance trait is a very cool addition that goes with the flavour of each instrument. <br>
We also gained some Quality of Life through Wandering Minstrel now providing a note every 10 seconds outside of combat, in a similar fashion to Virtuoso. <br>
They also listened to prior feedback and changed our boon from Alacrity to Quickness, but this came in the troubled form of Life of the Party, which is something I will discuss later in this post. <br>
Some of the Tales don't feel too responsive, and some lost their usefulness when the performance bonus was changed.
I will say right now though that with the loss of Hold the Note, the danger of stacking Troubadours is lessend, although it was a cool addition, and just changing our boon from Alacrity to Quickness was a large mitigation of that concern already.

## Feedback and bug list <br>

__Feedback__ <br>
* Fortissimo: Overshadows the other grandmaster traits, but instead of nerfing it. Make other grandmasters better/more functional.
* Call and Response (the Afterimage): Is not spawned with Fury.
* Call and Response (the Afterimage): Is not functioning with shatter traits like Cry of Pain (Illusions), Maim the Disillusioned (Illusions), Mayhem (Troubadour) and similar.
* Lively Lute (F1): Pierce removed
* Harmonious Harp (F4): To utilise it effectively for DPS you want to stow it, this is a pain point for many. Make it cancelable like Greatsword 4 on Guardian.
* Mayhem: Give it an additional condition or change the current condition for the CD, maybe give it CDR on disable (like Syncopate)?
* Tales in general: Most tales don't feel that impactful, exception for the Tale of the Honorable Rogue.
* Tale of the Second Scion: Give it some condition cleanse as well to make it a more attractive option for healing.
* Tale of the Tortured Mastermind: Overnerfed, and feels weird to use.
* Tale of the Valiant Marshal: No competition vs. Mantra of Concentration in most cases since the Barrier was removed.
* Tale of the August Queen: Lower cooldown in PvE or make Tales have 2 stacks and keep the same cooldown..
* Might upkeep: Increase might duration on Lively Lute and Tale of the Soulkeeper.
* Life of the Party: Concerns with how boons are applied, maybe make it so Tales give quickness when this is traited.
* Love Song: Effectively a dead trait, even in PvP.
* Instrument visibility, in general and UI.
* Instruments are now stripped on status reset
* Shatters don't feel impactful to hit, even though they have nice effects and/or damage. More feeling-related and feedback-related than numbers-related.
* Fractals: Give us all notes (also applies to Virtuoso blades) back when taking the Mistlock Singularity in fractals.

* Instrument buff upkeep can be very punishing:  <br>
A. Messing up your rotation is hard to recover from. <br>
B. Going downstate removes all instruments, and there are other cases where all your instruments can be removed (transforms etc). <br>
C. Bosses phasing at certain timings can be hard to deal with / Phases are hard to adapt your rotation around. <br>

__Bugs__ <br>
* Call and Response (Troubadour): Does not spawn the afterimage if no enemy is nearby or the enemy is invulnerable, which ruins the supportive aspects of the trait.
* Ego Restoration (Inspiration): Does not grant a clone when used with Tale of the Second Scion.
* Wandering Minstrel (Troubadour): The note generation part says **blade** instead of **note**
* Inspiring Distortion (Inspiration): Does not work with Harmonious Harp (F4)

## Point-by-point Community Feedback <br>
**Fortissimo** overshadows the other 2 Grandmaster traits, this is in part due to Call and Response being so broken with Shatter traits.

**Call and Response** effectively summons a phantasm that repeats the shatter. <br>
How unfortunate that it is dysfunctional with both Illusions and Shatter traits. <br>
To emphasise how broken it is, let's go over most traits that affect llusions and Shatters:
* Phantasmal Fury: Does not grant the afterimage fury
* Sharper Images: Makes the afterimage inflict bleeding.
* Blinding Dissipation: Does not grant the afterimage's shatter blindness.
* Shattered Concentration: Does not grant the afterimage's shatter boon removal.
* Mental Anguish: Does not work on the Afterimage's shatter.
* Sympathetic Visage: Afterimage does not take conditions.
* Illusionary Inspiration: Works on Afterimage summon.
* Restorative Illusions: Does not work on the Afterimage's shatter.
* Cry of Pain: Does not work on the Afterimage's shatter.
* Maim the Disillusioned: Does not work on the Afterimage's shatter.
* Illusionary Defense: Does not work on the Afterimage's shatter.
* Bountiful Disillusionment: Does not work on the Afterimage's shatter.
* Mayhem: Does not work on the Afterimage's Flustering Flute (F2).
* Shredding: Does not work on the Afterimage's Lively Lute (F1).

For some of these traits, you could argue that it says **when you use**, or it's an illusion, not a phantasm, or that it makes sense to not work because x, but for a trait that is effectively Chronophantasma, but for Shatters it makes little sense for it to not work with any shatter effects or phantasm effects. <br>
If it worked with Maim the Disillusioned and the other condition traits it would make it a very enticing pick for condition Troubadour and it would distinguish it from power Troubadour, which makes better use of Fortissimo.  <br>
Another pain point with the afterimage of Call and Response is that it does not have fury, making it a very RNG-heavy trait for power to pick, since you could easily not get a critical hit with the afterimage shatter.  <br>
So our request to the devs is to go over the shatter and illusion traits and consider if they should work on the afterimage. <br>

That or rework it entirely as it is dysfunctional in its current state beyond doubt, something that would work well for Heal Troubadour is if Call and Response made shatters instant cast by summoning the afterimage instantly on cast (so you get one shatter but instant cast). <br>
This is because it would grant it access to the shatter effects instantly, and give it access to instant cast condition cleanses from the Restorative Illusions (Inspiration) trait. <br>
But I'm in favour of just making it work with all shatter as well as some illusion traits instead.

**Altered Chord** is a cool trait in that it reduces the trait of Crescendo per shatter used and empowers Crescendo (F5) depending on the last shatter used before it.  <br>
But right now, it provides little competition as a DPS trait because of the uptime of the Lively Lute (F1) damage modifier. <br>
It could also need something else, maybe make it reduce F1 to F4 shatter cooldowns when using Crescendo by a little?

**Lively Lute** is a nice change and puts more emphasis on the healing theme, which is something Troubadour is clearly designed around.  <br>
But, it lost its piercing quality, which I would argue was unnecessary due to it being quite short-range already.

**Harmonious Harp** is an okay change but in this current iteration, the optimal way to utilise it for DPS is to stow it once you get the buff.  <br>
I personally do not mind this too much but I know that many people find it off-putting to have to stow for DPS. <br>
If we are going forward with this iteration of Harmonious Harp, an easy compromise would be to allow it to be cancelled like Guardian's Symbol of Resolution (Greatsword 4)

**Mayhem** feels a bit weird in the current design of Troubadour since the condition for the cooldown reduction is a dodge, and we, unlike Mirage, have no other synergies with dodges. <br>
The meme currently is that it is a Mirage-at-home kind of deal right now with this trait. <br>
Something that would feel more on theme would maybe be to give the cooldown reduction when you disable, so a condition version of Syncopate effectively.

**Tales in general** feel a little weak except for Tale of the Honorable Rogue.
The thing Honorable Rogue has is 2 charges while still having really strong effects.
So one proposal to buff Tales in general is to give them all 2 charges.

**Tale of the Second Scion**, to give it some additional value over Mantra of Recovery and to give Troubadour something it lacks in its kit, a condition cleanse would be very nice. <br>

**Tale of the Tortured Mastermind** was rather heavily nerfed, maybe justifiably so, as before it dealt around 75k damage per cast, mostly by its synergy with Syncopate.  <br>
But I wonder if keeping the old design but nerfing the base damage of the skill itself some and reducing the pulses by 1 would be a healthier choice, considering our other utilities do not deal too much damage. <br>
This skill also doesn't give the player much feedback as in, it just seems to disappear after casting it. <br>
To remedy this, it could be given a lingering AoE for the duration it is active with a nasty aura (they ought to be in a sour mood after getting hit with vicious mockery).

**Tale of the Valiant Marshal**, currently, this provides little value after its changes because it competes directly with Mantra of Concentration for stability.
The mantra is always better when providing stability, due to having 2 charges and a much shorter cooldown. Not to mention its charge effect
The resistance isn't that enticing because we have a decent chunk on rifle 5 whenever we need it.
So, an idea to buff the Tale would be to give it Barrier back as baseline and also slightly reduce the cooldown.

**Tale of the August Queen**, as a way to counter the difficulty of maintaining instruments in bosses with phases, a nice change would to lower the cooldown of the elite to 40 seconds or give it 2 charges. <br>
This would allow us to have up more frequently for phases to jumpstart our instruments more easily again after losing them in phases. <br>
A concern of this is obviously the distortion share, which is why I would only change this in PvE, but again I wish to reiterate that in the current balance of Guild Wars 2 and with the value of Signet of Humility's CC, the distortion share is not as egregious anymore. <br>
Tale of the August Queen is already a high price to pay compared to other Mesmer specs that can take Signet of Humility with a much smaller loss.

**Might upkeep**, on boon dps Troubadour is a bit hard since the might duration on Tale of the Soulkeeper is 15 seconds when the skill has a 16-second cooldown. <br>
This feels quite bad, and to have to invest a very small amount of boon duration to fix this feels bad. <br>
Similarly, on Lively Lute, an 8 second might duration on a 9.6-second cooldown (plus cast time) makes it inadequate for upkeeping might. <br>
To distinguish it from Boon Chronomancer and to give it an additional edge it would be an easy fix to change these might durations to allow it to upkeep might easily.

**Life of the Party**, this goes hand-in-hand with Tale of the Soulkeeper, which currently gives quickness freely.
There is a concern that if DPS Troubadour ever gets good DPS, you could run 4 or 3 (with soulkeeper) plus an Alacrity Chronomancer with Time Warp to upkeep permanent quickness.
To counter this you could remove the quickness on Soulkeeper and make Tales give Quickness on use when taking Life of the Party..
This solves another issue in that we currently have an awkward time providing quickness at 0% bd, due to duration and application windows.
The application windows mean that if someone were to leave the squad for a mechanic, then they could drop quickness uptime really easily until you could cast F1, Soulkeeper or Crescendo again.

**Love Song** with the change of Life of the Party being the boon trait now, it no longer seems to do much in PvE.<br>
A Heal Troubadour would take Life of the Party to provide boons, obviously. A DPS Troubadour takes Shredding, so which archetype takes Love Song?<br>
Even in PvP, I would argue Love Song has very little value, as you would either take Shredding for the raw damage it provides or Life of the Party as a DPS or Support to provide boons to yourself or allies. <br>
So, when does Love Song, in this iteration, currently see play?

**Instruments**, we've had some people complaining about instrument visibility, in that it can be hard to see the buff uptime clearly. <br>
A visual criticism of the Instruments is that they are too pink compared to their beta iteration, which worked more in terms of colours. <br>
While this bright pink is nice for visibility, it also seems to lack a bit of dimensionality due to lacking a clear texture, which other illusionary things do not.

Another change from the beta that heavily messes with power Troubadour is that instruments are now stripped on status reset, such as on starting a raid boss, as our opener is generally to precast Harmonious Harp (F4) and Tale of the August Queen. <br>
We would like to see this reverted as this functioned just fine in the beta, and it would force us to either time our F4 before the status reset or make weaker openers to compensate. <br>
**Instrument Upkeep** is very punishing, as mentioned in the above short feedback list, it is due to three things: <br>
A. If you were to mess up your rotation, it is very hard to recover from. <br>
B. Going downstate or experiencing transformations or similar will remove all instrument buffs <br>
C: Bosses with phases often leading to a very awkward time when returning to the boss, trying to regain control of all your instruments again <br>

We would like it if maintaining instruments and using shatters still felt precise and not spammy, like how shatters are used on condition Virtuoso, as an example, but were more forgiving on bosses that phase. <br>
Some suggestions towards this aim are: <br> 
* Reduce the cooldown of the elite Tale in PvE (suggested above).
* Make the instruments stack buff duration, instead of overwriting the current buff if it is shorter or ignoring if the current buff is longer than the new one.
* Increase the base duration of the buff while reducing the duration per note (one example is 8-second base and 4 per note). 

**Shatters** not feeling too impactful to hit is a sentiment also shared by people in our community, this refers to the specific feeling of hitting the ability, not that it doesn't do enough damage or have a good enough effect.

## Heal Troubadour vs. Heal Chronomancer <br>
Currently, to sum it up neatly. <br>

Heal Troubadour has over Heal Chronomancer: <br>
* More healing and barrier.
* Tale of the Honorable Rogue, its instant access to Aegis, Superspeed and Endurance.
* Tale of the August Queen, its access to distortion share but at a heavy cost of CC due to losing Signet of Humility.

Heal Chronomancer has over Heal Troubadour: <br>
* Still way more than enough healing to clear all content, even LCM content.
* Way More CC.
* Way More Utility due to Continuum Split and shorter cooldowns through Improved Alacrity
* Instant Cast Condition Cleanses, due to shatters being instant cast.

Let's get something out of the way. <br>
We cannot remove or significantly maim Continuum Split; it is the core mechanic of the elite specialization. <br>
Doing so for one overperforming build when Chronomancer has existed since 2015, and heal Chronomancer itself is a baby in comparison. <br>
Improved Alacrity is one choice, but it has also become an iconic trait, so much so that the developers have considered on the balance preview stream to make it baseline with Chronomancer. <br>
I would then say that yes, it is iconic and it shouldn't be removed for one overperforming build, it provides something that is very thematically fitting for a time mage, seeing the cooldowns tick down faster when Improved Alacrity is traited is also a very cool feeling. 

Instead, my proposal to fix Heal Chronomancer's Dominance is twofold:
First, nerf core healing of Mesmer by a large amount. This would be done by nerfing rifle and core traitlines while moving more into the Troubadour traitline and kits (healing modifiers as an example).
Second, remove some of Heal Chronomancer's Boon access in core traitlines. Heal Troubadour would be less affected by this as we have Tales for boons.

This would make it so Heal Chronomancer still works in low-pressure situations, and it keeps its niché in that it is really good for cc and utility.
That idea of utility and cc has been of the core identities of Chronomancer throughout the years for me so removing that would be an unwise choice in my opinion. Instead we could have it work for healing but barely.
If that is the path taken, that would mean that Heal Chronomancer couldn't be picked for every boss fight because it couldn't stand the heal pressure. <br>
With this, you also wouldn't have to remove its access to both Alacrity and Quickness.

## Summary <br>

While some changes from beta to release were beneficial for our overall gameplay, the nerfs were a bit overzealous.
The gameplay could still see more improvement when it comes to playing DPS on bosses with phasing due to the difficulty of upkeeping instruments.
Call and Response is a largely dysfunctional trait due to it not really working with either illusion or shatter traits. What is its identity? A chronophantasma for shatters or is it a phantasm, or let it be both?

Heal Troubadour saw some improvements but also some steps back on its path to actually compete with Heal Chronomancer as a healer.
Tale of the Honorable Rogue is a really strong skill, while Tale of the Valiant Marshal sees little purpose in its new iteration.
In terms of utility and CC it still falls really behind Chronomancer which is a large drawback when healing in this game is generally overtuned.

Overall, I'm hopeful that they can solve Troubadour as a whole but right now it's not looking that good, so with that, I hope for changes.

Thanks for reading!
Cheers Tipcat.
