Hi, you may know me as Tipcat aka the crazy cat person who mains Mesmer in PvE. <br>
Visions of Eternity, and by extension, Troubadour has been out for a little while now, and I have been playing it extensively in all types of content.

So, I figured I should make a feedback post of my own and the sc help desk community's feedback and wanted changes.

Let's start by reviewing the changes from the beta to release.

## Beta to release review

In the beta we saw power Troubadour doing around 48.6k damage with relatively little time to refine rotations as both me and Cemox didn't really have too much time during the beta. <br>
As a note, I personally think that iteration of power Troubadour could hit 51k.

In the current release we see **power Troubadour** doing around 43k damage, with an alternative harder-to-play Power Block setup resulting in a 17% damage increase potential. <br>
Overall, power Troubadour plays a lot like power Virtuoso but it has some nice traits and distinctions to set it apart. <br>
A big one being Syncopate, which capitalises on the fact that Troubadour already has more frequent disables than any other Mesmer build. <br>
This opens up options and synergises with a lot of things within the Mesmer kit. <br>
For one we can take Shield as a viable off-hand weapon which is a first, but we can also take Power Block over Vicious Expressions in Domination which yields a nice damage increase resulting in a more active gameplay loop where you have to make sure you interrupt your target for damage. <br>
It also opens up use for potential use of Mantra of Distraction as a DPS tool. 

**Condition Troubadour** didn't see much play as a lot of interactions weren't working properly, and surprise, they still aren't working all too well. <br>
These include Call and Response not triggering Shatter effects like Maim the Disillusioned, Cry of Pain or even Mayhem. <br>
More detail will be spent talking about Call and Response later in this post. <br>
We did see dedicated players managing to push condition and condition quickness Troubadour to 37k and 33k, respectively. <br>
Which makes it look not completely devoid of hope as a build. 


**Heal Troubadour** while providing more raw heal output and barrier, is still found to be lacking a lot of utility compared to its older sibling in Heal Chronomancer. <br>
This has been remedied a little bit by giving Tale of the Honorable Rogue Aegis instead of Stability. <br>
Distortion share is not as big of a balance shakeup anymore in today's Guild Wars 2 as other forms of utility and tools have been power crept in its absence, which means it doesn't really have too much of an unique advantage over Heal Chronomancer. <br>
Taking Tale of the August Queen also means sacrificing a lot of CC output due to dropping Signet of Humility. <br>
But we will also go into Heal Chronomancer a tiny bit and what could be done in this post. <br>

In the release we saw a fair amount of nerfs to our damage output but also changes that made the rotation easier to execute, unforatunely I think the nerfs were a bit overzealous and the gameplay changes a bit lacking since we still struggle a fair bit.

But okay, what actually changed?

    Reverberating Lute: This skill has been reworked and renamed Lively Lute. Send damaging sound waves toward an enemy and healing tones toward allies.
    Deafening Drum: Increased the speed of the shock wave.
    Harmonious Harp: This skill has been reworked. Gain distortion as you channel the harp, continuously healing nearby allies.
    Crescendo: Reduced the power coefficient from 1.25 to 1.0 in WvW and PvP.
    Tale of the Second Scion: Reduced the cooldown from 25 seconds to 15 seconds and reduced the casting time by 0.25 seconds. Reduced the base self-healing from 4,815 to 3,535 and the base ally healing from 3,530 to 2,250. This skill now always applies Scion's Reprieve to allies and grants a note when used while two or more instruments are playing. Reduced the Scion's Reprieve healing increase from 33% to 20% in PvE and from 20% to 15% in WvW and PvP.
    Tale of the Soulkeeper: This skill now applies quickness in addition to its previous effects. This skill no longer applies alacrity in PvE.
    Tale of the Tortured Mastermind: Reduced the cooldown from 25 seconds to 20 seconds in PvE only. Increased the power coefficient per hit from 0.75 to 1.0 and increased the daze duration from 2 seconds to 3 seconds in PvE only. This skill now always applies torment on hit and grants a note when used while the flute is playing.
    Tale of the Honorable Rogue: This skill no longer applies swiftness and removes movement-impairing conditions and instead applies aegis in PvE and PvP and stability in WvW. This skill now always applies superspeed and grants a note when used while the drums are playing.
    Tale of the Valiant Marshal: This skill now applies stability instead of protection in PvE and PvP. This skill now grants a note instead of barrier when used while the harp is playing.
    Wandering Minstrel: This trait now grants a note every 10 seconds while out of combat.
    Mayhem: This trait now reduces the cooldown of Flustering Flute when you dodge and no longer heals when applying torment or confusion while the flute is playing.
    Raconteur: This trait has been reworked and moved to the adept tier, replacing Hold the Note. This trait now causes tales to heal and grant protection to nearby allies.
    Syncopate: This trait no longer requires the drum to be playing to deal damage when you disable.
    Symphonic Resonance: This trait has been reworked and moved to the master tier minor trait slot. Gain unique bonuses for each instrument playing.
        Lute: Increased outgoing damage and healing.
        Flute: Increased endurance regeneration.
        Drum: Increased movement speed.
        Harp: Heal nearby allies every second.
    Shredding: This trait now causes Lively Lute to fire an additional projectile instead of increasing damage per wave. Reduced the damage increase while the lute is playing from 20% to 15% in PvE only.
    Life of the Party: This is a new trait in the master tier. Lively Lute and Crescendo apply boons to affected allies.
    Love Song: This trait has been reworked. It causes Harmonious Harp's distortion to last longer and reduces incoming strike damage from nearby enemies while the harp is playing.
    Harmonize: This trait has been reworked and moved to the grandmaster tier minor trait slot. Gain a note when you use a phantasm skill.
    Fortissimo: Reduced the attribute increase per instrument playing from 5% to 4%.
    Altered Chord: This trait now requires an instrument to consume at least one note to grant the Crescendo recharge.

Overall, the changes made the rotations easier to execute because we are less note starved with the new Harmonize trait iteration, as well as the Tales no longer rely as much on the corresponding instrument for maximum effect. <br>
But as mentioned we lost some damage through Fortissimo going from 5 to 4% all stats per instrument, and by losing the Harmonize modifier per instrument. <br>
The new Symponic Resonance trait is a very cool addition that goes with the flavour of each instrument. <br>
We also gained some Quality of Life through Wandering Minstrel now providing a note every seconds outside of combat, in a similar fashion to Virtuoso. <br>
They also listened to prior feedback and changed our boon from Alacrity to Quickness, but this came in the troubled form of Life of the Party, which is something I will discuss later in this post. <br>
I will say right now though that with the loss of Hold the Note, the danger of stacking Troubadours is lessend, although it was a cool addition and just changing our boon from Alacrity to Quickness was a large mitigation of that concern already.

## Feedback and bug list <br>

__Feedback__ <br>
* Fortissimo: still overshadows the other grandmaster traits, but instead of nerfing it. Make other grandmasters bettter.
* Call and Response (the Afterimage): is not spawned with Fury.
* Call and Response (the Afterimage): is not functioning with shatter traits like Cry of Pain (Illusions), Maim the Disillusioned (Illusions), Mayhem (Troubadour) and similar.
* Lively Lute (F1): Pierce removed
* Harmonious Harp (F4): To utilise it effectively for DPS you want to stow it, this is a pain point for the many.
* Mayhem: give it an additional condition or change the current condition for the CD, maybe give it CDR on disable (like Syncopate)?
* Tale of the Second Scion: give it some condition cleanse as well to make it a more attractive option for healing.
* Tale of the Tortured Mastermind: Overnerfed?
* Might upkeep: Increase might duration on Lively Lute and Tale of the Soulkeeper.
* Love Song: Effectively a dead trait, even in PvP.
* Instrument UI visibility.
* Instruments are now stripped on status reset
* Shatters don't feel impactful to hit, even though they have nice effects and/or damage. More feeling related than numbers related.

* Instrument buff upkeep can be very punishing:  <br>
A. Messing up your rotation is hard to recover from. <br>
B. Going downstate removes all instruments, and there are other cases where all your instruments can be removed (transforms etc). <br>
C. Bosses phasing at certain timings can be hard to deal with / Phases are hard to adapt your rotation around. <br>

__Bugs__ <br>
* Call and Response: does not spawn the afterimage if no enemy is nearby or the enemy is invulnerable, this ruins the supportive aspects of the trait.
* Ego Restoration: does not grant a clone when used with Tale of the Second Scion.
* Inspiring Distortion (Inspiration): Does not work with Harmonious Harp (F4)
* Auspicious Anguish: Test if it converts conditions

## Point-by-point Community Feedback <br>
**Fortissimo** overshadows the other 2 Grandmaster traits, this is in part due to Call and Response being so broken with Shatter traits.

**Call and Response** effectively summons a phantasm that repeats the shatter, how unfortunate that it dysfunctional with both Phantasm and Shatter traits. <br>
To emphasise how broken it is, let's go over most traits that affects Pllusions and Shatters:
* Phantasmal Fury: Does not grant the afterimage fury
* Sharper Images: Makes the afterimage inflict bleeding.
* Blinding Dissipation: Does not grant the afterimage's shatter blindness.
* Shattered Concentration: Does not grant the afterimage's shatter boon removal.
* Mental Anguish: Does not work on the Afterimage's shatter.
* Sympathetic Visage: Test if afterimage takes condition
* Illusionary Inspiration: Works on Afterimage summon.
* Restorative Illusions: Does not work on the Afterimage's shatter.
* Cry of Pain: Does not work on the Afterimage's shatter.
* Maim the Disillusioned: Does not work on the Afterimage's shatter.
* Illusionary Defense: Does not work on the Afterimage's shatter.
* Bountiful Disillusionment: Does not work on the Afterimage's shatter.
* Mayhem: Does not work on the Afterimage's Flustering Flute (F2).
* Shredding: Does not work on the Afterimage's Lively Lute (F1).

For some of these traits you could argue that it says **when you use** or that it makes sense to not work, but for a trait that is effectively Chronophantasma but for Shatters it makes little sense for to not have any shatter effects or phantasm effects function with it.  <br>
If it worked with Maim the Disillusioned and the other condition traits it would make it a very enticing pick for Condition Troubadour and it distinguishes it from power Troubadour which makes better use of Fortissimo.  <br>
Another pain point with the afterimage of Call and Response is that it does not have fury, making it a very RNG-heavy trait for power to pick since you could easily not get a critical hit with the afterimage shatter.  <br>
So our request to the devs is to go over the shatter and illusion traits and consider if they should work on the afterimage. 

**Altered Chord** is a cool trait in that it reduces the trait of Crescendo per shatter used and empowers Crescendo (F5) depending on the last shatter used before it.  <br>
But right now it provides little competition as a DPS trait because of the uptime of the Lively Lute (F1) damage modifier.

**Lively Lute** is a nice change and puts more emphasis on the healing theme, which is something Troubadour is clearly designed around.  <br>
But, it lost its piercing quality, which I would argue was unnecessary due to it being quite short range already.

**Harmonious Harp** is an okay change but in this current iteration the optimal way to utilise it for DPS is to stow it once you get the buff.  <br>
I personally do not mind this too much but I know that many people find it offputting to have to stow for DPS.

**Mayhem** feels a bit weird in the current design of Troubadour since the condition for the cooldown reduction is a dodge and we, unlike Mirage, have no other synergies with dodges. <br>
The meme currently is that it is a Mirage-at-home kind of deal. <br>
What would feel more on theme would maybe be to give the cooldown reduction when you disable, so a condition version of Syncopate effectively.

**Tale of the Second Scion**, to give it some additional value over Mantra of Recovery and to give Troubadour something it lacks in its kit, a condition cleanse would be very nice. <br>

**Tale of the Tortued Mastermind** was rather heavily nerfed as before it dealt around 75k damage per cast mostly by its synergy with Syncopate.  <br>
But I wonder if keeping the old design but nerfing the base damage of the skill itself some and reducing the pulses by 1 would be a nicer choice.

**Might upkeep**, on boon dps Troubadour is a bit hard since the might duration on Tale of the Soulkeeper is 15 seconds when the skill has a 16 second cooldown. <br>
This feels quite bad, and to have to invest a very small amount of boon duration to fix this feels quite bad. <br>
Similarly, on Lively Lute, a 8 second might duration on a 9.6 second cooldown (plus cast time) makes it inadequate for upkeeping might. <br>
To distinguish it from Boon Chronomancer and give it an additional edge it would be an easy fix to change these might durations to allow it to upkeep might easily.
