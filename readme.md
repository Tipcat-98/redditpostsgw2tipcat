The beta week is upon us!
Power Troubadour is looking like it's ready to musically dominate and shatter egos with vicious mockery!
Heal Troubadour on the other hand will distort time and repel harm with its soothing serenades!

Friendly reminder: to prepare your bank with everything you need as your account is snapshotted when you create your first beta character.
Gear, food, utility, jade bots, relics and all the rest is needed!

__**Power Troubadour**__
From crunching numbers it looks like Fortissimo is by far the stronger trait for power but I've included an Altered Chord/Call & Response build below as well for anyone curious to experiment.
Call & Response is sadly looking very behind anything else.

Tale of the Tortured Mastermind hits hard, for both power and condition troubadour, so that is expected to be taken anywhere.
Mantra of Pain is always a steady damage increase and we don't really have that many damage utilities to take, so it is a solid pick.
For the third slot, it will depend on how Signet of Illusions interacts, if it resets all instruments and Crescendo then it definitely looks to be the best choice. 
If not then we have some other things to test like Tale of the Soulkeeper for might and note generation, Mantra of Distraction to trigger Syncopate or, but is very unlikely since we don't have that high illusion effective power, Phantasmal Disenchanter.

When it comes to generating Alacrity, we simply press F4 and Tale of the Soulkeeper off-cooldown.

Rotation ideas:
We can precast instruments (we can but we don't know if it gets stripped *yet*) so there is the idea to precast all 4 instruments out of combat and then start combat with Tale of the August Queen.
This way we can immediately benefit from the empowered state of Tale of the Tortured Mastermind.
Otherwise, it will look quite similar to Power Virtuoso in terms of Da/Sw & Spear loops.

__**Heal Troubadour**__
Heal Troubadour is looking to be the strongest healer with insane healing power with Fortissimo and other healing modifiers in the traitline
Not to mention its access to distortion share.
Through the tales it also has access to any boon or utility you could need, along with the powerful core mesmer toolkit on top of that.
Then finally, on top of all of that, it also has boon extension available in Hold the Note.

Call & Response and Altered Chord are also strong traits that could be taken when needed.

The gear set above aims to provide an optimized build if we were to go Fortissimo as a healer but Call & Response and Altered Chord both have uses.

To maintain alacrity (hah! you have 100% boon duration), just press F4.
